# OPUS-Spectral-Data-Converter
This Python project provides a batch data conversion tool for Bruker OPUS files, which are commonly used in FTIR analysis.
It extracts raw spectral data (such as absorbance, single-channel signals) and exports them into structured `.xlsx` files with multiple sheets.
The tool was primarily developed for use in Room 202, Agricultural Sensing Department, Suyuan Building.
